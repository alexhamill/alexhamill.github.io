        <p class="start left"> ~ Stuffing is my favorite thanksgiving dish but I am vegetarian so it is hard to find vegetarian stuffing at thanksgiving. Thankfully my uncle is also vegetarian and a good cook so he shared this recipe with me. He said “I had really good luck with my stuffing this year at my thanksgiving party so I just wanted to share the recipe with you so you could try it out”. Some tips and tricks are pressing the garlic with a garlic press and adding the leeks to the onions after the onions start sauteing. This recipe serves 20-30 so it is for a bigger thanksgiving and the prep time is 15 minutes and 1 hour in the oven.
