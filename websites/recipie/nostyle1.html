    <h2>Best Yams with Cranberries and Apples Recipe </h2>
    <p>This recipe is a staple of my thanksgiving dinner at my grandmother's house. I never liked it very much but it is still a part of every thanksgiving for me. My mom said that it was <q> tangy and sweet in just the right way</q>. A tip is to not mix the fruits too much because you don't want to turn them too much. This recipe serves 6-8 people and takes about 1 hour and 30 mins to make.</p>
