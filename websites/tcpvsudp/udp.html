        <hr>
        <h3>TCP</h3>
        <p><strong>TCP</strong> uses a conection bassed system to transfer data. First it establises a conection between the computers. 
            then a packet is send between the computers. Then an acknowledgement it sent to make sure that all of the packet arived.
            <strong>TCP</strong> also is able to sequence the packets so that they are able to be sent in a specific order
        </p>
        <h3>UDP</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>UDP</strong> does not make a conection with the target computer before sending the packets.
            it just sends the packets and does not wait for a acknowledgement. There is so sequencing so it just sends in any order.
            There is no error checking so if packets dont arrive or arrive damaged it cannot tell.
        </p>
