# Reflection on encryption

## symmetric and asymmetric encryption

### symetric

* uses the same encryption key for both people
* you have to keep the key protected when sending between users
* difficult to scale up for many people

### aysmmertic

* uses difrent keys for the person sending and reciving the message
* the public key is public and can be sent freely to anyone with out them being
able to read anything
* can be scaled up for many people

## steps of encryption

1. person reciving the message sends their public key to the sender
2. person sending the message encrypts the message with the recivers public key
3. sender sends the encrypted message
4. reciver gets the message and uses their private key to decrypt the message

## dont share your key

if you share your public key people can decrypt the message that are being sent
throughout all of the internet just as if they were unprotected and they can
read eveything you are doing online
