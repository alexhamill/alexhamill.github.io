# Wordpress project



  I made a for a fictional bakery in Rosslyn. It is very aptly named Rosslyn Bakery. I modeled my website off a few other websites. Firstly I got the idea for the background to be a photo from the [magnoliabakery website](https://www.magnoliabakery.com) . This website had a big picture on the homepage which I used on my website. From the [eclairons website](https://www.eclairons.com)  i got the idea to make a video of the dough being made. And i got the idea for a hiring page from the [bakeshop website](https://www.bakeshopva.com/).

  while I was making this website with wordpress I definitely found some of the limitations of wordpress. Firstly I really wanted to add a    video to the background of something but i couldn't do that with the plan that I had. I also wanted to change the text color of some of my websites but you had to pay for that. I did find that making the website was overall more helpful if you didn't know how to use html to code but it was still quite a struggle to figure out how the website worked with a lot of trial and error.
