# Wordpress project


I made a for a fictional bakery in Rosslyn. It is very aptly named Rosslyn Bakery. I modeled my website off a few other websites. Firstly I got the idea for the background to be a photo from the [magnoliabakery website](https://www.magnoliabakery.com) . This website had a big picture on the homepage which I used on my website. From the [eclairons website](https://www.eclairons.com)  i got the idea to make a video of the dough being made. And i got the idea for a hiring page from the [bakeshop website](https://www.bakeshopva.com/)
